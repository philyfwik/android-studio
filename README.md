# Recreation Center Mobile App

This app was built to improve the accessibility of recreational centers.

It is a high-level prototype of a mobile application to allow a recreational center's members to access recreational information.

Italso allows members to book, register and pay for events at the recreational center, as well as reserve recreational resources and equipments.

Questionnaires were also conducted to gain better and more realistic insight on the app's usability criteria and its users' experience goals.
